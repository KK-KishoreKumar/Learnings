Here, the intention is to understand the network driver flow. Collected many resources under the docs folder and
Code under the templates folder. The first thing to start with is the driver flow by Jangir. The flow explains the driver
based out of rt8139 and simple transmit and receive flows. Good starting.
+ Next step was to understand the internals of the network, API's and so on. Refer the slides from Free Electrons. Saved as
network-drivers.pdf. Gives a very nice high level flow.
+ Another detailed architecture discussion was found at slideshares. Very important for understanding the internals. Its saved as network_architecture.pdf
