<h1>Serial Drivers</h1>
                                <p align=right>by Alessandro Rubini</p>

<P>This article is meant to show the internal structure of device
drivers for serial ports, and how they can be perform a variety of
services including <i>ppp</i> and <i>slip</i>.  The discussion is
based on 2.4 source code, but most of the material applies equally
well to 2.2 and 2.0.

<!-- =============================================================== -->
<h3>The usual view of a serial port</h3>

<P>When discussing the software implementation of a serial port, the
first thing that comes to mind is <code>/dev/ttyS0</code>, as this is
the most known character of serial communication, at least on PC-class
computers. Since <code>/dev/ttyS0</code> is a file special file of
type ``char'', a serial driver is often considered a conventional char
driver, and phrases like ``char drivers are exemplified by serial
ports'' come to mind. Unfortunately, the exemplification is basically
wrong.

<P>If you look in the real code, you'll see how the ``char driver''
idea only scratches the surface of what a serial driver is, and that's
why a serial driver doesn't quite lend itself to be the prototypical
example of char drivers.

<P>Actually, the ``char driver'' abstraction doesn't correctly
describe serial device drivers because there is not specific major
number associated to each of them. Actually, you can have add-on
serial ports that plug in your computer and are managed by specific
kernel modules but do not get assigned a new major number.

<!-- Do we need a box about major numbers? I'd like to avoid that, but
maybe you don't agree with me that it's a known idea. Obviously "char
driver" must be considered known -->

<P>Looking in <code>/proc/devices</code> you'll find that major 4 is
associated to the <code>ttyS</code> driver, but that's a white lie:
text-mode console devices belong to major 4 too, and, actually,
Linux-2.0 used the more general ``<code>ttyp</code>'' name for major
number 4.

<P>What makes a serial port different from a more conventional char
driver like the printer port or a tape drive is its being part of the
tty abstraction. Since a serial communication channel can be used to
plug an alphanumeric terminal, a serial device driver must be
integrated in the terminal emulator layer, called the ``tty''
abstraction, from the name of ancient tele-type devices (still in wide
use when Unix was being written)

<!-- =============================================================== -->
<h3>Overview of tty management</h3>

<P>Flexible and powerful tty handling is made up of several building
blocks. You must consider that there exist a huge range of tty
devices, from VGA and frame-buffer based text consoles up to serial
communication channels and virtual terminals as exemplified by (but
not limited to) the <code>xterm</code> application.

<P>Figure 1 shows the various building blocks that are involved with
operation of a serial driver.  Most files live in <i>drivers/char</i>,
if not, the directory specified is relative to the root directory of
the kernel source tree. The figure shows how each building block is
registered (registration is there in order to allow each block to be
implemented as a kernel module).

<hr>


<P>The file <i>fs/devices.c</i> exports the interface used by most
system resources to register device drivers, each identified by a
major number). This is how <code>tty_register_driver</code> gets hold
of a major number if it needs it to support the new tty driver (an
object that is introduced below). The function is defined by
<i>tty_io.c</i>, which also defines the file operations that are used
to act on tty devices. File operation are the driver-specific
implementations of <i>read</i>, <i>write</i> and the other system
calls that relate to file access.

<P>What <i>serial.c</i> or other serial drivers do in order to run
their own code is registering a <code>struct tty_driver</code> object.
The ``driver'' declares the major number and the range of minor
numbers it is going to manage, as well as a number of operations it
supports. The operations are concerned with input and output of data
as well as flow control and communication with higher layers.  The
implementation of these operations, together with interrupt handling
and actual input/output of data is the scope of hardware
drivers for serial ports.

<P>The data flow between user space and the serial device driver,
therefore, is mediated by the tty layer, that implements
functionalities that are common to all tty-type devices. However, not
all of tty management is defined be <i>tty_io.c</i>, most of the policy
is define by the <i>line discipline</i>, a software module that
disciplines how a physical tty I/O line is used.  The default line
discipline for Linux is called <code>N_TTY</code>, a name that will be
explained later. If <i>n_tty</i> is active, input data reaches user
space via the usual <i>/dev/</i> interface and the standard terminal
I/O handling (i.e, all the features defined by
<code>&lt;termios.h&gt;</code>, that make terminal handling so
powerful and so difficult).

<P>The red line in figure 1 shows the logical flow of data, from the
hardware channel up to the user-accessible device special file and
backwards. What keeps it all together is the <code>struct tty</code>
data item, that in itself includes a pointer to all three relevant
objects: the <code>file_operations</code> structure that is used in
communicating with user space, the <code>tty_driver</code> structure
that hosts functions to control real hardware, and the
<code>tty_ldisc</code> structure that lists all entry points to the
current line discipline.

<!-- =============================================================== -->
<h3>Why so complex?</h3>

<P>Sure this kind of arrangement may look exceedingly
complex. However, as usual, the extra complexity is meant to make
things ultimately more flexible and powerful. Adding support for new
serial hardware may be different from writing a conventional char
driver, but this setup guarantees full tty emulation on all serial
ports without any code replication or unneeded complexity in the
low-level driver.

<P>Another advantage of this kind of arrangement, possibly even more
important than generalized tty support, is in the ability to change
the line discipline associated to each tty device. Unlike typical
device drivers, whose task is connecting an hardware device with user
space, a serial driver has nothing to do with user space; data it
receives from the hardware is passed over to the line discipline, and
data it receives from software comes via a line discipline method.

<P>A serial driver, therefore, is not concerned in any way with data
transfer to/from user space. The task is left to the line discipline,
together with all the hairy <code>termios</code> handling. This makes
it possible for serial data to be steered to a different user-space
access facility than its associated <i>ttyS</i> device special file.

<!-- =============================================================== -->
<h3>PPP and slip</h3>

<P>Whenever you dial your modem with <i>ppp</i> to connect to the
Internet, or use the simpler <i>slip</i> communication protocol to
connect the PC to your Linux palm-top, you are exploiting the
complexity just shown. Both <i>ppp</i> and <i>slip</i> implement their
own line discipline; when either of them is run, the tty device is
switched to a different line discipline in order to detach
<i>/dev/ttyS0</i> from the serial port and keep all of serial
communication within the kernel.

<P>Figure 2 shows the conceptual layout in the <i>slip</i> case. I
chose not to use <i>ppp</i> in the example to avoid extra complexity
or incorrect simplification. In version 2.4 of the Linux kernel the
<i>ppp</i> software implementation is split in several files (once
again, it's more structured to be more powerful and avoid code
replication across similar devices). The two protocols behave
otherwise in the same manner.

<br><b>Figure 2</b>

<hr>

<p>The role of the <i>slip</i> driver, as shown, is registering both a
network device (depicted as <code>slip0</code> and a line discipline
for tty devices (called <code>N_SLIP</code>). When the tty device is
switched to the new line discipline, TCP/IP communication can begin.
The new line discipline sets up data transfer between serial hardware
and the network layer; when it is active, nothing can be read from or
written to the associated <i>/dev/ttyS</i> device. As soon as the
device (<code>/dev/ttyS0</code> or equivalent) is closed, the default
line discipline is restored. Actually, that's the main reason why
neither <i>slattach</i> nor <i>pppd</i> can exit after setting up the
network channel.

<!-- =============================================================== -->
<h3>The individual data structures</h3>

<P>There are three main data structures involved in tty management
(and thus, serial communication):

<UL>

<LI><code>struct tty_struct</code>: this is the data structure that
	stays at the core of tty management. It includes both of the
	following structures. An instance of <code>tty_struct</code>
	is created any time a new tty device is opened, and exists
	until it is last closed. Note that actual code (in
	<code>tty_io.c</code>) is complicated by the need to preserve
	<code>termios</code> settings across close and open, at least
	for some of the ttys (like serial ports).

<LI><code>struct tty_driver</code>: this is the low level hardware
	handling. At open time, the function <code>get_tty_driver</code>
	retrieves the driver for the current tty an places it into
	the <code>driver</code> field of <code>tty_struct</code>, where
	it is further accessed.

	<code><pre>
	struct tty_driver {
	
	    /* the driver states which range of devices it supports */
	    short major;         /* major device number */
	    short minor_start;   /* start of minor device number*/
	    short   num;         /* number of devices */
	
	    /* and has its own operations */
	    int  (*open)();
	    void (*close)();
	    int  (*write)();
	    int  (*ioctl)();  /* device-specific control */
	
	    /* return information on buffer state */
	    int  (*write_room)();      /* how much can be written */
	    int  (*chars_in_buffer)(); /* how much is there to read */
	
	    /* flow control, input and output */
	    void (*throttle)();
	    void (*unthrottle)();
	    void (*stop)();
	    void (*start)();
	
	    /* and callbacks for /proc/tty/driver/<name> */
	    int (*read_proc)();
	    int (*write_proc)();
	};
	</pre></code>

<LI><code>struct tty_ldisc</code>: the structure is referenced by the
	<code>ldisc</code> field of <code>tty_struct</code>. At open
	time the field is initialized to reference <i>n_tty</i>, and
	user programs can change the current line discipline via
	<i>ioctl</i>, as explained in a while.

	<code><pre>
	struct tty_ldisc {
	
	    /* routines called from above */
	    int     (*open)();
	    void    (*close)();
	    ssize_t (*read)();
	    ssize_t (*write)();
	    int     (*ioctl)();
	
	    /* routines called from below */
	    void    (*receive_buf)();
	    int     (*receive_room)();
	    void    (*write_wakeup)();
	};
	</pre></code>
</UL>

<P>The structures are declared in three different files:
<code>tty_struct</code> is a complex structure defined in
<i>include/linux/tty.h</i>, a header generally devoted to tty
issues. Actually, it is not as interesting to look at as the other
two, because user modules rarely need to directly interact with it.

<P><i>include/linux/tty_driver.h</i> and
<i>include/linux/tty_ldisc.h</i> are devoted exclusively to the
definition of the relevant data structures. The files carry a
prominent comment block that explains the exact role of most of the
fields. Unlike <code>tty_struct</code>, both <code>tty_driver</code>
and <code>tty_ldisc</code> are actively used by authors of device
driver modules.

<P>Typically, a kernel module that supports a new kind of hardware
transmission will implement a <code>tty_driver</code> structure, while
a module that uses generic serial hardware for a new purpose will
implement a line discipline. For example, if you have a special
keyboard that transmits data via a standard RS-232 serial port, you'll need a
line discipline that gathers data packets and send them to either
the input mechanism (see <i>drivers/input/input.c</i> and
<i>include/linux/input.h</i>) or to the generic keyboard driver (using
<code>handle_scancode()</code>, exported by
<i>drivers/char/keyboard.c</i>). 

<!-- listing 1 and 2 here. While L1 is large, L2 is thin so it can fit
in one column -->

<P>Listing 1 shows the most important operations declared by the
<code>tty_driver</code> data structure, while listing 2 depicts those
exported by the line discipline. Note that those listings are by
no means complete, if you look for authoritative information, 
you should read the relevant header files.

<!-- =============================================================== -->
<h3>Data flow in reading and writing</h3>

<!-- figure 3 here or nearby -->
<hr>
<p><img src="fig3.png" border=2>
<br><b>Figure 3</b>
<p>The image is available as PostScript <a href="fig3.ps">here</a>
<hr>

<P>Figure 3 visualizes how data flows from user space down to hardware
interfaces and backwards. It refers to the specific case of a standard
PC serial port with the default line discipline attached. The logical
stacking of line disciplines (near to user space) and tty drivers
(near to the hardware itself) should be apparent.

<P>While writing data is straightforward, the reading process may need
some explanation. Reading is more complex than writing because there's
no direct causal relationship between hardware (that pushes up data
when it arrives) and user space (that requests data when it needs it).
The solution is, as you expected, use of buffering: data received by
hardware remains on hold in a kernel buffer until a user space program
requests it; whenever a user program asks for data and the buffer is
empty, the program is put to sleep, and is awaken only when the buffer
is filled with at least partially. Note that a write buffer exists as
well, however, the <i>write</i> implementation is much more
straightforward because each step towards hardware level is directly
driven by the step above it. There are no uncontrolled delays in data
transmission, and the buffer is only needed to decouple hardware
transmission from program flow. The figure does not show it for
simplicity.

<P>When tty devices are concerned, the read buffer lives within the
tty data structure; while this makes <code>struct tty_struct</code>
considerably bigger, there is no point in keeping the buffer
elsewhere: each tty can't transfer data without a buffer, and tty
devices are dynamically allocated so no memory is wasted in buffers
for unused devices.

<P>Actually, tty-related buffering is organized in two levels: kernel
developers chose to provide both a ``conventional'' buffer, where data
is waiting to be eaten by the line discipline (i.e., in the default
case, being transferred to user space), and a ``flip'' buffer, used by
hardware routines to store incoming data as quickly as possible,
without the need to synchronize for concurrent access: flip buffers
are exclusive ownership of the hardware device, which eventually calls
<i>tty_flip_buffer_push</i> to deliver data to the tty buffer, where
the line discipline pulls it from.

<P>It's interesting to note that the flip buffer is laid out as two
physical buffers that are alternatively written to. This allows more
reliable operation, as the interrupt handler will always have a whole
buffer available for writing.  The function <i>flush_to_ldisc</i>,
called by the low-level driver and part of the tty layer (i.e.,
<i>tty_io.c</i>), arranges for the flip buffer to be flipped, before
the interrupt handler returns. This layout, by the way, is why
the flip buffer is called so.

<!-- =============================================================== -->
<h3>How to use a custom line discipline</h3>

<P>Kernel code, as stated, can register a new line discipline with the
tty subsystem, and this is also available to modularized code. You
could, therefore, write your own line discipline and register it.
Each line discipline is identified by a number, and a symbolic
name for it is available, as common with C programming. Assigned
numbers are given a name by <i>include/asm/termios.h</i>.

<P>The default tty line discipline is identified by a number of
<code>N_TTY</code>, PPP uses <code>N_PPP</code> and so
on. Unfortunately, no line discipline numbers have currently been
reserved for ``local use'', so you can only experiment with the
numbers that are not used on your system. Actually, no official driver
currently used <code>N_MOUSE</code>, so this is a good bet for your
custom line discipline.

<P>In order to activate the <code>N_MOUSE</code> line discipline, the
user space program must use this code:

<code><pre>
    #include <sys/ioctl.h>

    int i = N_MOUSE;
    ioctl(fd, TIOCSETD, &i);
</pre></code>


<!-- =============================================================== -->
<h3>The role of register_serial</h3>

<p>If you noted that <i>drivers/char/serial.c</i> exports a function
called <i>register_serial</i>, you may wonder what's its role in the
tty architecture just outlined. As a matter of facts, the facility is
only an hook offered by the ``standard'' serial tty driver in order to
easy run-time addition of standard serial ports. The ``serial'' being
registered is not a whole software module, but rather, only a
definition or parameters to use for the new serial port. The
parameters are described by <code>struct serial_struct</code>, which
in turn is defined by <i>include/linux/serial.h</i>; they are used by
the conventional serial driver, exploiting the de-facto
standardization that exists on PC serial ports. You can't use the
function to register a driver for serial hardware of a different kind
than a 16450 or compatible UART. The list of supported hardware for
the PC platform is found in the array <code>uart_config</code>, in
<i>serial.c</i>. Other platforms offer different implementations for
<code>register_serial</code>.

<!-- =============================================================== -->
<h3>The serial console</h3>

<p>Serial ports can also be used as console devices, and this kind of
functionality is separate from tty management. Actually, the console
device sits in the lowest levels of Linux, as it must bring critical
information out of the system as soon as possible.  It just can't be
involved in all the complexity of tty management.  But in version 2.4
(as well as 2.2) console management is a world of its own, with its
own data structures and functions that make it very flexible yet
reliable. Discussion of such world is best delayed to next month's
column.
